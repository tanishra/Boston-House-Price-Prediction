# Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project implements a Linear Regression model with L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to predict house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. A Streamlit web application is also developed to allow users to input data and get price predictions.

## üìå Project Overview

 - Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset (from U.S. Census Service)
 - Model: Linear Regression with Regularization (Lasso, Ridge)
 - Preprocessing: Standardization using StandardScaler
 - Web UI: Built using Streamlit
